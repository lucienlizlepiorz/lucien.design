Title: about

----

Text: Having attended university for graphic design, I was always fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. This led to some self-instructed, object-oriented programming, and four shipped apps across three platforms.

Day after day, my dual love has ushered in new understandings, fresh perspectives, and maximized opportunities. I am invigorated by cross-functional collaboration: magic happens when the knowledge of an individual becomes the knowledge of a group. 

In my spare time, I heartily enjoy playing with LEGOs, expanding my MÃ¤rklin model train collection, and going on deep Wikipedia quests.
