Text: Drawing inspiration from topography, the *NEXT* 2015 identity expresses both the Corcoran's heritage and the journey that lies ahead. Individual paths unite in one community: the resemblance to a fingerprint heightens this concept.

Key responsibilities: wordmark, wayfinding signage, print invitation, microsite, gallery map/directory (iPad app). Created with Grace Boyle, Francheska Guerrero, David Hodgson, Anders Larsson, and Nora Mosley.

Set against the backdrop of a merger between the Corcoran and George Washington University, wordmap ideation allowed each junior designer to craft an identity defined by these focal points. 

From a group of three options, the final direction (my individual design) combines organic movement with technical structure: a synthesis of identities.

In addition to providing an additional level of visual interest (one that also retains the viewer's focus on form and legibility), cool tones compliment the branding program's architectural context.

Visual vocabulary included topographic forms and solid gradient fields that mimic the wordmark's movement. Both elements add depth and dimension, further highlighting an interdisciplinary identity.

The microsite and iPad app introduced black transparencies and blurred, gradient-like imagery. In addition to refining each deliverable's hierarchy, these techniques emulate the qualities of physical texture, form, and distance.
