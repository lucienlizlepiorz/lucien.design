Set against the backdrop of a merger between the Corcoran and George Washington University, wordmap ideation allowed each junior designer to craft an identity defined by these focal points. 

From three competing options, stakeholders selected my direction. It combined organic movement with technical structure: a synthesis of identities.

Cool tones provided additional visual interest, maintained the viewer's focus on legibility, and complimented the branding program's architectural context.

Visual vocabulary included topographic forms and solid gradient fields that mimicked the wordmark's movement. Both elements added depth and dimension, further highlighting an interdisciplinary identity.

The microsite and iPad map/directory app introduced black transparencies and blurred, gradient-like imagery. These techniques allowed the digital deliverables to emulate physical texture, form, and distance.

It was an honor to have my work displayed across hundreds of square feetâ€”and across from the White House. Tight deadlines taught me how to excel under pressure, and a broad set of deliverables cultivated my affinity for systems.

Final accountabilities included visual concepting, brand development, invitation design, wayfinding system, web development, and iOS development. Created with Grace Boyle, Francheska Guerrero, David Hodgson, Anders Larsson, and Nora Mosley.
