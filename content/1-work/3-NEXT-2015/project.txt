Set against the backdrop of a merger between the Corcoran and George Washington University, wordmap ideation allowed each junior designer to craft an identity defined by these focal points. 

From a group of three options, the final direction (my individual design) combined organic movement with technical structure: a synthesis of identities.

In addition to providing an additional level of visual interest (one that also retained the viewer's focus on form and legibility), cool tones complimented the branding program's architectural context.

Visual vocabulary included topographic forms and solid gradient fields that mimicked the wordmark's movement. Both elements added depth and dimension, further highlighting an interdisciplinary identity.

The microsite and iPad app introduced black transparencies and blurred, gradient-like imagery. In addition to refining each deliverable's hierarchy, these techniques emulated the qualities of physical texture, form, and distance.
