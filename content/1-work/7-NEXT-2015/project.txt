Text: Drawing inspiration from topography, the *NEXT* 2015 identity expresses both the Corcoran's heritage and the journey that lies ahead. Individual paths unite in one community: the resemblance to a fingerprint heightens this notion. Digital components included comprehensive development and maintenance. Created with Grace Boyle, Francheska Guerrero, David Hodgson, Anders Larsson, and Nora Mosley. Individual responsibilities: wordmark, wayfinding signage, print invitation, microsite, directory & map kiosk.

Set against the backdrop of an institutional merger between the Corcoran and George Washington University, wordmap ideation allowed each junior designer to craft an identity rooted in these key concepts. From a group of three options, the final direction (my individual design) combines organic movement with technical structure: a synthesis of identities.

In addition to providing an additional level of visual interest (one that also retains the viewer's focus on form and legibility), cool tones compliment the branding program's architectural context.

Visual vocabulary included the integration of abstract forms and solid gradient fields that mimicked the wordmark's movement. Both elements add depth and dimension, further highlighting an interdisciplinary nature.

Digital components introduced black transparencies and blurred, gradient-like imagery. Intended as a means to refine hierarchical relationships, these techniques emulate the capabilities of physical texture, form, and distance.
