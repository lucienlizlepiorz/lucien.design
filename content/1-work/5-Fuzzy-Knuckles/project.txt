Text: Envisioned as an homage to the designer, Fuzzy Knuckles takes Erik Spiekermann’s Fira Sans as a base upon which thousands of hairs generate and grow. Utilizing Processing, a field of vector origin points allows each strand to mutuate in direction, length, and opacity.

As much as any other artistic field, typographic form expresses personality: Fuzzy Knuckles emerged from the desire to integrate corporeal elements into the technical arena of vectors and strokes.

Careful tweaking of the generated hair’s density and length resulted in code that could consistently produce the perfect amount of playful tufts.

Generated as vectors, each letterform emerges from Processing as pure form, free of rasterization and ready for usage at any scale.
