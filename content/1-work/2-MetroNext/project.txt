Text: As a daily Washington, DC commuter, WMATA’s arrival predictions for both rail and bus are an essential asset. Before this project, the mobile Windows ecosystem lacked any compact and intelligently-designed applications for the purpose. Through the utilization of Microsoft’s panoramic interaction pattern, users may readily access arrivals for both rail and bus stops, active service advisories, and favorited stations.

Windows 8’s panorama control allows for rapid access to any section, eliminating the need for potentially disorienting navigational structures. By placing rail and bus arrivals adjacent to each other, users may compare upcoming trips via either mode.

Colors directly correspond to each rail line: all other elements recede to a secondary level through the use of gray text.

Bus stops prominently display identification numbers, thereby rendering their usage as natural for regular commuters. Due to the possibility of visitors not recognizing these features, future updates will include the option of automatically locating nearby stops.
