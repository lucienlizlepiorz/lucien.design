Text: Every year, Allstate dispatches over 1 million roadside rescues across the United States and Canada. 4 million phone calls are handled by hundreds of Rescue Associates, who each use two dispatching applications. Alamoâ€™s onboarding to the newer of these two, Omni, shaved over 40% of call time and dramatically improved reliablity across the roadside ecosystem.
