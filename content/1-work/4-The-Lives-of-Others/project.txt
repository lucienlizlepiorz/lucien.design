Text: Touching on themes of institutionalized suppression, artistic subversion, personal doubt, and unknown intimacy, *The Lives of Others* follows a cog in the Stasiâ€™s police machine. Looped footage of cold, metallic environments communicates an oppressive atmosphere; before transitioning, each named entity disintegrates into indecipherable code, and ultimately, oblivion.
