Text: As a Washington, DC commuter, WMATA's arrival predictions for both rail and bus were an essential asset. Before I began this project, the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem had been severely lacking any glanceable or intelligently-designed transit apps. Through the use of platform-specific interaction patterns, MetroNext allowed users to rapidly swipe between arrivals for both rail and bus stops, active service advisories, and favorited stations.

Windows Phone 8's panorama control let each section sit at the top level of hierarchy, in addition to enhancing user context. By placing rail and bus arrivals next to each other, users could compare upcoming trips via either mode.

Colors directly corresponded to each rail line: all other elements receded to a secondary level through the use of gray text.

In the physical world, bus stops prominently displayed their identification numbers. MetroNext naturally leveraged this ingrained data point, and also reaffirmed the user's selection by displaying the location's name.
