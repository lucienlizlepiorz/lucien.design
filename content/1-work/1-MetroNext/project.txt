Text: As a Washington, DC commuter, WMATA's arrival predictions for both rail and bus were an essential asset. Before I began this project, the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem had been severely lacking any glanceable or intelligently-designed transit apps. Through the use of platform-specific interaction patterns, MetroNext allows users to rapidly swipe between arrivals for both rail and bus stops, active service advisories, and favorited stations.

Windows Phone 8's panorama control allows each section to sit at the top level of hierarchy, in addition to providing situational context. By placing rail and bus arrivals next to each other, users may compare upcoming trips via either mode.

Colors directly correspond to each rail line: all other elements recede to a secondary level through the use of gray text.

In the physical world, bus stops prominently displayed their identification numbers. MetroNext naturally leverages this ingrained data point, and also reaffirms the user's selection by displaying the location's name.
