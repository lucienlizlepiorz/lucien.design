Text: Addressing a gap in the marketplace, ship.it joined two of the most popular shipping queries–rates and tracking information–with an approachable, concise interface. Users could immediately compare service levels, costs, and tracking details between FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service. Additional features included international localization and currency conversion.

During planning, the proposed feature set included user account creation via Facebook. As this would have primarily benefited the fringe case of users with multiple devices, the integration was deprioritized.

An emphasis on lowercase capitalization and friendly error notifications humanized the experience: obtuse data became approachable.

Rates and tracking information used color schemes derived from each carrier. This unified elements across interactions and reinforced context.

Optional package names allowed for quick recognition: anonymous numbers gained personal meaning.

Based on a package's delivery status, an "on the way" category helped users prioritize. Users could also delete individual packages or clear their history.

International localization included dynamic strings, as well as automatic date and timestamp conversion. Negotiating these translations resulted in concise text across languages.

ship.it took my foundational knowledge of software development and advanced it to a professional level. It has allowed me to communicate with engineers on a peer-to-peer basis and untangle technical blockers for the benefit of design.  

Final accountabilities included roadmap planning, user experience direction, technical architecture, Android development, API integration, and user acceptance testing.
