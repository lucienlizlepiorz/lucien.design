Text: Addressing a gap in the marketplace, ship.it joined two of the most popular shipping queries–rates and tracking information–with a series of approachable, concise interfaces. Through the EasyPost API, users could immediately compare service levels, costs, and tracking details between FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service. Additional features included support for both Spanish speakers and foreign unit systems.

During planning, the proposed feature set included optional user account creation via Facebook. As this would have primarily benefited the fringe case of users with multiple devices, accounts were sacrificed for an increased focus on core functionality.

An emphasis on lowercase capitalization and friendly error notifications humanized the entire experience: obtuse data became approachable.

When requesting either rates or tracking information, users encountered color schemes derived from each carrier's branding identity. This broad application united elements across interactions and reinforced context.

Optional package names allowed for quick recognition: anonymous numbers gained personal meaning.

Based on a package's delivery status, an "on the way" category helped users prioritize. Users could also delete individual packages or clear their history.

Multi-lingual support included localized strings, as well as automatic conversion of dates and time stamps into the user's natural format. Negotiating these translations ultimately resulted in concise text across languages.
