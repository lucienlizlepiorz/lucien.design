Showcasing undergraduate 2D design work from the Corcoran School of the Arts & Design, corcoran:Design provided users with a canvas of thumbnails to explore. The highlighted work spanned two majors and four years of instruction. Each individual project contained CDN-hosted images, a brief description, and the student's portfolio link. 

After iOS App Store certification, corcoran:Design was employed by academic recruiters for a one-year period.

Thumbnails of varying scale and placement established three levels of hierarchy, while an interwoven grid simultaneously emphasized the cross-functional nature of undergraduate design work.
