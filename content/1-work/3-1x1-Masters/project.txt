Text: 1x1 Masters–utilizing a visual language of bitmapping and anti-Modernist composition–compares Matthew Carter, Zuzana Licko, and Rudy VanderLans: three of the digital age’s most prominent type designers. Image treatments reflect not only the original medium, but notions of influence and inextricable connection. Initially a 6" x 9" book, this design was later translated into an interactive publication via InDesign’s DPS suite of tools.
