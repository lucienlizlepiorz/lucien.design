Text: 1x1 Masters–utilizing a visual language of bitmapping and anti-Modernist composition–compares Matthew Carter, Zuzana Licko, and Rudy VanderLans: three of the digital age’s most prominent type designers. Image treatments reflect not only the original medium, but notions of influence and inextricable connection. Initially a 6" x 9" book, this design was later translated into an interactive publication via InDesign’s DPS suite of tools.

Bitmapped photography, in conjunction with a screaming color palette and out-of-sequence line arrangement, abandons traditional design relationships in favor of aesthetic investigation that reverses the roles of text and image.

Each highlighted statement utilizes a distinct typeface from the early digital era, rendering the text as both an example of visual form and ideological narrative.

Existing content readily adapts to the digital medium, and an interactive dictionary of relevant typographic terms provides a touch of geeky depth.
