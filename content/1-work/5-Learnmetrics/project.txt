Connecting educators and administrators with the data that surrounds their students, Learnmetrics required an identity that communicated both this mission and a sense of humanity.

Preliminary team exercises included arranging sticky notes with values that corresponded to what individuals perceived Learnmetrics to be, in addition to what the company could and should represent.

Visual research and inspiration drew upon a multitude of sources, spanning architecture, data visualization, and educational iconography.

In addition to flowing, organic forms, a focus on simple, constructed components arose. When used in aggregate, these building blocks lent each visual application a sense of energy, synthesis, and precision.

To gauge existing messaging and avoid any potential branding clashes, the research stage included an assessment of marketplace competitors.

Sketching concepts touched numerous depictions: network nodes, roots, stylized graphs, and physical books all made appearances. By exploring both literal and conceptual directions, the process could focus on an approach that equally resonated with stakeholders, users, and the public.

Two narratives began to dominate, one in which the logo communicated data management, and another that expressed the marriage of data with education. The former directly appealed to existing users and professionals, while the latter resonated with future clients and unaffiliated viewers.

When attempting to soften the frigidity of complex information, I wondered: should the icon include a literal human, or instead, humanlike attributes?

Work then transitioned to the computer: multiple monochrome versions arose alongside a typographic lockup set in Circular. The typeface's precise curvature seamlessly corresponded to the dual identity of data and education. A punchy period heightened impact and embodied the role of a technological challenger.

Color applications followed, with palettes that employed slightly-saturated tints of somber hues. Decisive Data began to lean towards illustration, whereas Root Nexus reduced each emotion to the minimal number of components.

Following a formal presentation, Decisive Data universally resonated with stakeholders. A simplified graph was divided into two segments, highlighting the software's transformative power.

In order to clearly communicate the creative process to remote team members, a progress update document summarized each direction's development, inspiration, and public interpretation.

An additional revision leveled the playing field of abstraction versus illustration: white space replaced interior graphs, padding around the pencil increased, and softened edges propagated throughout the form. These edits reduced the rigidity of a stylized tool and lent a heightened level of movement.

Responding to stakeholder concerns, two tangential directions were presented. Both built upon earlier themes of humanity and enlightenment, but with the added constraints of an enclosing polygon.

Consensus grew around the honeycomb shape, yet it lacked the educational identity of Decisive Data. Reintroducing the illustrative pencil solved the problem and gave humanity to the background stream of fractured data.

Executives immediately identified with both the new iconography and refreshing palette of medium-saturation blues and greens. Graphik, by Christian Schwartz of Commercial Type, replaced Circular as the wordmark's typeface due to an increased selection of weights, optimized rendering, and heightened linearity.

By selectively reversing the application of white, the logo could be used on backgrounds of various excitement levels.
