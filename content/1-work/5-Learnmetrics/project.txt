Connecting educators and administrators with the data that surrounds their students, Learnmetrics required an identity that communicated both this mission and a sense of humanity.

Preliminary team exercises included arranging sticky notes with values that corresponded to what individuals perceived Learnmetrics to be, in addition to what the company could and should represent.

Visual research and inspiration drew upon a multitude of sources, spanning architecture, data visualization, and educational iconography.

In addition to organic forms, a focus on modular construction arose. These building blocks lent each visual a sense of energy, synthesis, and precision.

To gauge existing messaging and develop a competitive edge, the research stage included marketplace assessment.

Sketches touched several depictions: network nodes, roots, stylized graphs, physical books. By exploring literal and conceptual directions, the process could focus on an approach that resonated with stakeholders, users, and the public.

Two narratives began to dominate, one in which the logo communicated data management, and another that expressed the marriage of data with education. The former directly appealed to existing users and professionals, while the latter resonated with potential clients.

When attempting to soften the frigidity of complex information, I wondered: should the icon include a literal human, or instead, human-like attributes?

Work then transitioned to the computer: multiple monochrome versions arose alongside a typographic lockup set in Circular. The typeface's precise curvature seamlessly corresponded to the dual identity of data and education. A punchy period heightened impact and embodied the role of a challenger.

Color applications followed, with palettes that employed slightly-saturated tints of somber hues. Decisive Data began to lean towards illustration, whereas Root Nexus was reduced to the minimum number of components.

Following a formal presentation, Decisive Data universally resonated with stakeholders. A simplified graph was divided into two segments, highlighting the software's transformative power.

In order to clearly communicate the creative process to remote team members, a progress update document summarized each direction's development, inspiration, and public interpretation.

Another revision increased the level of abstraction: white space replaced interior detail, padding surrounded the pencil, and softened edges propagated throughout. These edits reduced rigidity and added movement.

Responding to stakeholder concerns, two tangential directions were presented. Both built upon earlier themes of humanity and enlightenment, but with the added constraints of an enclosing polygon.

Consensus grew around the honeycomb shape, yet it lacked the educational identity of Decisive Data. Restoring the illustrative pencil solved the issue and added a human touch.

Executives immediately identified with the new iconography and refreshing palette. Graphik, by Christian Schwartz of Commercial Type, replaced Circular as the wordmark's typeface due to an increased selection of weights, optimized rendering, and heightened linearity.

By selectively reversing the application of white, the logo could be used on backgrounds of various excitement levels.
