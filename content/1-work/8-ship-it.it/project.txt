Text: Addressing a gap in the marketplace, ship.it joins two of the most requested shipping queries–rates and tracking information–with a series of approachable, concise interfaces. Through the EasyPost API, users can immediately compare service levels, costs, and tracking details between FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service. Additional features include support for both Spanish speakers and foreign unit systems. Pending release on Google Play.

During planning, the proposed feature set included optional user account creation via Facebook authentication. As this would primarily benefit the fringe case of users with multiple installations, accounts were sacrificed for an increased focus on core functionality.

An emphasis on lowercase capitalization and friendly error notifications humanizes the entire experience, further helping to render obtuse data as approachable by anyone.

When requesting either rates or tracking information, users encounter color schemes derived from each carrier’s branding identity. Instead of presenting individual logos alongside a single color palette, this broad application unites elements across interactions and provides subtle reinforcement for the user.

Optional package names provide quick recognition and fully bridge the enterprise and consumer spaces: anonymous numbers gain personal meaning. Based on a package’s delivery status, two distinct categories aid in organization. Users may additionally clear their entire history or individually delete entries.

Multi-lingual support includes localized strings, as well as automatic conversion of dates and time stamps into the user’s natural format. Negotiating these translations ultimately resulted in concise text across languages.
