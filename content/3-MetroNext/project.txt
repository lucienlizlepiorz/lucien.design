Text: As a Washington, DC commuter, WMATA's arrival predictions for rail and bus were an essential asset. Before I began this project, the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem lacked any digestable, local transit apps. Through the use of platform-specific interaction patterns, MetroNext allowed users to rapidly swipe between rail and bus stop arrivals, active service advisories, and their favorite stations.

Windows Phone 8's panorama control enhanced user context by providing a preview of the next section. By placing rail and bus arrivals next to each other, users could compare upcoming trips via either mode.

Highly-glanceable colors corresponded to each rail line: all other elements used a secondary shade of gray.

In the physical world, bus stops prominently displayed their identification numbers. MetroNext leveraged this familiar data point for searches, and then rendered the street address for affirmation.

When MetroNext was accepted into the app store, I couldn't believe it. In three months, I had gone from having zero understanding of software development to integrating with an API. It's a constant reminder of what dedication can do. 

Final accountabilities included user experience direction, technical architecture, Windows Phone 8 development, API integration, and user acceptance testing.
