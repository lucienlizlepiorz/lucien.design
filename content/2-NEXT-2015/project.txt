Set against the backdrop of a merger between the Corcoran and George Washington University, a group of junior designers framed their conceptual brands with a collective wordmap.

From three competing options, university stakeholders chose my direction. Lines flowed organically across each structured letter: a synthesis of identities.

Cool tones provided additional visual interest, maintained the viewer's focus on legibility, and complimented the branding program's architectural context.

Visual vocabulary included topographic forms and solid gradient fields that mimicked the wordmark's movement. These elements added depth and enhanced the interdisciplinary metaphor.

It was an honor to have my work displayed across hundreds of square feetâ€”and across from the White House. Tight deadlines proved my ability to excel under pressure, and a broad set of deliverables cultivated my affinity for systems.

Final accountabilities included visual concepting, brand development, invitation design, wayfinding, web development, and iOS development.
